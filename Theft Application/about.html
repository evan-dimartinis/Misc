            <p>Project Title: Prince George's County Theft Map</p>

            <p>Group Members: Julio Claros, Kishan Patel, Ryan Singh, Zack Richards, Evan DiMartini</p>

            <p>This project was created for our INST 377 class during the Spring 2020 semester. This web application's purpose
            is to investigate the relationship between auto theft and other types of theft in Prince George's county though
            visual comparison on our map.

            We hope to aid residents in Prince George's county through our project by getting a general idea of where there are
            hot spots for theft in the county and which types of theft more more likely to occur in a particular area.</p>
